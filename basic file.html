            <h3>Newbie Graphics Designer</h3>
            <p>
                As a graphics designer, I just started my career as a potrait designer and cartoon artist. However, at time blows, that fascination has been dropped due to some unforced reason. Still I have had some of those graphical ideas. I have used one of my recent image as a cartoon inside this particular blog. That one may not that eye-catching, however, I preferred that one to display as my idendity of image. And so now I am paying full of my concentration as a genuine cartoon artist as well potrait artist on the graphical based career. Actually graphics design is my hobby. So I need not that much professionalism, rather than it's a hobby and I am happy with that.
